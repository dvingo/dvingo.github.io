title: "Restaurants and Software Architecture"

If you pay attention you will begin to notice patterns in everyday life.
A particular example usually occurs in the summer, as you walk by
a restaurant where the public entrance is street side and a few meters away
is the kitchen entrance. In some cases they are very close together and positioned in such a way that you get a view into the dining room with a
handsome host or hostess waiting to greet visitors, elegant lighting, beautifully
thought out interior decoration and (if you were to enter) soft, calming music
to dine to. As you continue to walk you get a view into the kitchen, with the stove top range shooting flames a meter into the air, lots of people working in close proximity with stains on their clothing and a general feeling of being hurried
 and panic-stricken, as well as loud music with a fast rhythm promoting high
energy.

After observing these features of restaurants enough times I couldn't help but see the analogy to software platforms: The front end is polished with well thought out designs for the user interface (the interior design of the dining room), the menu design which applies the same principles of user interface
design in software such as balance, negative space, typography, size, and proportion, color theory, et cetera. Then you continue to the kitchen where things
are like the back end of a software stack: messy, loud, and dirty, not
meant for public consumption (like the stereotype of most software developers :) ). You apply your proprietary algorithms to create a unique
product. You both take raw ingredients of data, programming
languages, and tools in the software case; raw food, cooking tools, and
chemistry in the restaurant case, to create your business value. Both back ends
also share that they are not to be viewed by the public and that the public usually
doesn't want to see them either, they just want their delicious product, which to
them may as well be created using magic.

It is interesting to me how easily the analogy worked in this case, especially
since restaurants are much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant#History">older</a> than software. Leading me to think there is something inherent in
humans and how we organize our systems into subsystems recursively.

Being in software makes you view the world differently:
you see data structures and algorithms everywhere. Clustering patterns of
people bring to mind clustering algorithms with people represented
 by vertices in a graph data structure, to the obvious analogy of natural trees
to the data structure with the same name, to distributed patterns applied to
 insects such as bees and ants. I think most of us take for granted how the
structures of our society can map to ideas in software (granted you would have
to be versed enough in software principles to make the connection) and more than likely how ideas from software can be applied to our society to improve
 the systems we use to operate the human world. Restaurants are just one
easy to map idea, but it is not difficult to see the relationship between corporate
and government structures to software architectures as another example.

I am sure the same connections could be made to other areas of study. I imagine
biology, chemistry, and astronomy being easy targets due to the recursive
structures of those fields - for example in astronomy: a universe is composed of galaxies, which is composed of solar systems, which are composed of stars and planets, et cetera - but I unfortunately do not
have much domain expertise in these areas, and thus applied the thought to
software. Although, one advantage of being versed in software is how everything
is abstract from the start so you are trained to think of things one or two levels
up the abstraction chain, whereas I am not certain this would apply to other
disciplines.
