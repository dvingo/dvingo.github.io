A parasol in which the fabric is made up of photovoltaic sheets - something like these [guys](http://gigaom.com/2013/07/10/nanosolar-is-now-selling-off-its-solar-assets/) were supposed to make. The end of the handle has a U.S. standard 120V electrical socket and maybe a USB socket as well.

This could be in various sizes, like a patio umbrella for stationary use, as well as the usual parasol size.
