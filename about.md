This is the personal site of Dan Vingo.

I'm a computer programmer currently living New York City.

The posts on the site are a combination of random, sometimes stream of conscious ideas, and
 more full fledged writing.

## Some things I've built

### A primitive music making app, right in the browser (written in ClojureScript and Om):

[https://dvingo.github.io/web-audio-cljs/](https://dvingo.github.io/web-audio-cljs/)

It's not fully fleshed out, so here's some basic instructions:

- Click the microphone icon and make some nice samples
- Select the part of the wave form you want to make a sample from
- Click "Make Sample"
- Click "New Track"
- Select that track (it will have a dashed border)
- Click the sample you just created
- Click the "Play" button to toggle playback (make sure your speakers are adjusted).
- Click and drag the sample along the track to change when it plays.
- Then have some fun adding more tracks, samples and recordings!

### A filesystem tree visualizer, using d3, ember.js, express, and neo4j:

Click on a project and then click on leaf nodes to view those files (scroll down).

I was learning Neo4j and ember at the time, and wanted a consise, high-level view of code repostitories.

I also gave a talk on this project at the Ember.js NYC May 2014 Meetup.

### A time tracking iOS application (circa 2013):

From a past life when I did iOS development. My account expired so it's not available in the app store
and, I'm assuming, requires some updating just to run on the newer OS versions.
