Use pain as a general AI strategy for teaching computers to teach themselves
things (aka learn).

Pain seems to be a general quality of life - if we stick to organisms.

Pain is a very effective way to quickly learn something about an action.
We can encode certain behaviours that a computer can perform with quantities
of pain (hedons and dolors perhaps). The computer process will tend to not
perform actions which are painful, and tend to prefer those that are hedonistic.

If you start with some axiomatic base cases that you define for the computer,
then build some composition functions to generalize how to compute a quantity
of pain for a certain action then you can perform a tree search over a space
of possibilities to have the process choose actions to perform, just like
a person who decides their own next actions based on in-the-moment feelings
of pleasure and pain as well as predicting future expected pain and pleasure
from possible next actions, which leads people to perform an action.

One application of this would be for a general data transformation tool, with
the goal of automatic data schemas to different versions aka tedious data
transformation that is typically written by hand and difficult to generalize.
